| fill_timeout_seconds | uint | 180 | Fill with bots after this wait (shorter in test config) |
| tick_rate | uint | 30 | Simulation ticks per second |
| snapshot_interval_ticks | uint | 5 | Interval for delta snapshots (between full) |
| full_snapshot_interval_ticks | uint | 30 | Interval for mandatory full snapshots |
| bot_difficulty | uint | 1 | Bot AI difficulty level (placeholder) |
| bot_fire_interval_ticks | uint | 60 | Bot firing cadence (ticks; clamped lower in test_mode) |
| movement_speed | float | 2.0 | Tank linear speed (units/s) |

| turret_disable_front_hits | uint | 2 | Frontal hits required to disable turret motor |
| disable_bot_fire | bool | false | When true bots never fire (overrides bot cadence) |

| auth_stub_prefix | string | user_ | Prefix for stub auth user IDs |

Test configuration example: see `config/server_test.yaml` for a faster iteration profile (reduced cooldowns, higher projectile damage, smaller map, `test_mode: true`).

Bot fire controls: `disable_bot_fire: true` in config or runtime flags/env (`--no-bot-fire`, `T2D_NO_BOT_FIRE=1`) force bots to never shoot (reflected in `MatchStart.disable_bot_fire`).

AI targeting: Bots always ignore tanks with `hp == 0` even when `persist_destroyed_tanks: true` keeps corpses in snapshots.

Subsystem Damage: Track and turret impairment thresholds are controlled via `track_break_hits` and `turret_disable_front_hits`. Setting either to 0 disables that impairment type (no accumulation). These flags replicate as booleans per tank (`track_left_broken`, `track_right_broken`, `turret_disabled`). Broken tracks reduce movement effectiveness; disabled turret stops rotation.

Delta Snapshot Contents (current): tanks, new projectiles, removed_tanks, removed_projectiles, crates (changed/new), removed_crates. Ammo boxes (static until picked up) are sent only in full snapshots; when picked up they simply disappear from subsequent full snapshots (delta optimization pending).

Fields may evolve; new keys are ignored by older binaries (forward compatibility); unknown keys are skipped with defaults.
